# Prediction-with-Multiple-Regression
Multiple Regression Assignment

Use Case
Predict startup profit using investment features like R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. Helps companies identify where to invest for maximum return.

Tools Used
Python
pandas, numpy – data handling
seaborn, matplotlib – EDA & visualizations
scikit-learn, statsmodels – regression modeling

Key Insights
R&D Spend has the strongest positive impact on profit
Administration and State have little to no effect
Simplified models with fewer features performed similarly to full models
Best model achieved R² ≈ 0.95, indicating high predictive power


Use Case
Predict the selling price of used Toyota Corolla cars based on features like Age, KM driven, Fuel Type, HP, Weight, and more. This supports better pricing strategies for car dealerships and used car platforms.

Tools Used
Python
pandas, numpy – data cleaning & wrangling
seaborn, matplotlib – EDA & visualizations
scikit-learn, statsmodels – regression modeling & feature selection

Key Insights
Age, KM driven, and Weight are strong predictors of price
Fuel Type and HP also contribute significantly
Models with feature selection performed better with reduced multicollinearity
Achieved a reliable R² score indicating good model fit for price prediction
